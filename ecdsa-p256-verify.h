/*
 * Verify signature 'sig' (size 'sig_len' bytes) against public key
 * 'pub' (of size 'pub_len' bytes) over hash value 'hv' (of size
 * 'hv_len' bytes). The hash value MUST have been obtained from a
 * cryptographically secure hash function with an output of size at
 * least 32 bytes (usually, SHA-256 is used). The signature format is
 * "raw": the two components (r,s) of the signature are encoded as
 * unsigned integer in big-endian convention, over 32 bytes each, and
 * concatenated in that order. The public key uses the "uncompressed"
 * format, of size exactly 65 bytes (the first byte must have value 0x04).
 *
 * Returned value is 1 on success (signature is valid) or 0 on
 * error. An error is reported in any of these cases:
 *  - signature size is not correct;
 *  - public key size is not correct;
 *  - hash value size is less than 32 bytes or is greater than 64 bytes;
 *  - signature does not have a valid format (i.e. either r or s is zero
 *    or is not lower, as an integer, than the curve order).
 *  - public key does not have a valid format (one of the coordinates
 *    is out of its nominal ranges, or the point is not on the curve);
 *  - signature verification algorithm fails.
 *
 * Exact rules follow FIPS 186-5, section 6.4.2, with the hash value 'hv'
 * being 'H = Hash(M)' as computed in step 2. This implementation adds an
 * explicit check that the provided hash value length does not exceed
 * 64 bytes, because that would indicate that the caller is not provding
 * a hash value but the message itself, which is insecure (the use of a
 * cryptographic hash function is necessary for the overall security).
 * In any case, the verification algorithm starts by truncating the hash
 * value to the curve size, which is 32 bytes for curve P-256, and the
 * extra bytes are simply ignored. Hash values _shorter_ than 32 bytes
 * are also rejected because they mechanically cannot provide the "128-bit"
 * security level that is usually expected from the curve (and FIPS 186-5,
 * section 6.1.1, makes such rejection mandatory).
